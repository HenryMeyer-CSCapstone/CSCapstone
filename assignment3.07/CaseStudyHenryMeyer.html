  <h1>Case Study</h1>
  <h4>
  <div class="container text-center">
  <b>Recap of case study claim:</b> The American Public Transportation Association, is a non profit international association that pushes for advocacy for federal funding in transit systems, policies, research, and many more transit related programs. They represent all kinds of public transportation and are partnered with many public transportation companies. They make sure everyone’s voice is heard, expand connections to foster communities, expand knowledge on the subject, and advance career skills for its members.
  <div class="container text-center"></div>
  <b>Explanation: </b>The APTA is a trusted association of many organizations, representing a majority of the public transportation companies across the country, they are proving how societies with public transportation are far better than car dependent ones, they are advocating for change, and are seeing actual results. It is important a diverse group of perspectives is listened to and implemented into change, as we can accomplish so much more when hearing from a wide variety of people.
  <p></p>
  <div class="container text-center">
  <b>Effectiveness claim: </b>Effectiveness claim: The APTA is very effective in what they do as they have a presence in congressional testimonies, and are able to make their voices heard, so legislators know what they want. They have award winning publications on public transportation, meaning they have had an influence on many readers of their writing that advocate for these systems.
  <div class="container text-center"></div>
  <b>Explanation: </b> Being able to have direct contact with legislators means that they are able to have a considerable amount of influence on policy regarding public transportation, so the APTA is able to advocate for increased funding in transit systems directly to congress. Their award winning publications are able to reach a large audience too, people who may be unaware or uninterested in the issues regarding public transportation are able to learn more from the research they have done and their expertise on this subject.
  <p></p>
  <div class="container text-center">
  <b>Use of tech claim: </b>The role of technology in addressing the issue is online advocacy, as well as holding online conferences and meetings, and information seminars. They have a subcommittee of “Research and Technology,” and in 2018, they held a summit to “explore how changes in technology” are “transforming the public transportation sector and creating opportunities for a variety of integrated mobility services” (Wikipedia).
  <div class="container text-center"></div>
  <b>Explanation:</b> They are looking at how technology can affect public transit systems, as technology can advance many systems, and public transit is just one of them. While they do not appear to have a ton of implementation of technology yet, it seems like they will in the future. They use their online website and publications to inform and educate people about the issues relating to public transportation, and discover new information, innovations, and technologies that will help solve problems about public transit. 
  <p></p>
  <div class="container text-center">
  <b>Implications for my actual project: </b>The most effective thing I could do to help create change and support for this problem is to create an app that incentivizes public transportation usage, while also being fun to use, while also providing news and older information on the subject to inform users. 
  <div class="container text-center"></div>
  <b>Explanation: </b>An app is going to be the best way to use technology to influence changes with our current system of public transportation. It is important that an app like this is created so public transportation usage increases, and implementation of innovative technology always gets more people to use something. It is important to make it user friendly and fun, as well as adding rewards so that users are actually incentivized to use public transportation and the app.
