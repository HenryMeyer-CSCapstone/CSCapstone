    <h1>Initial Research</h1>

    <h4>
    <div class="container text-center">
    <b>Problem Statement: </b>
    Public Transportation is widely unavailable across the USA, but highly underutilized by citizens who do have access to it. There is not enough support around public transportation, and more advocacy by mainly oil and car companies to make our society reliant and dependent on cars.
    <p></p>
    <div class="container text-center">
    <b>Need Statement: </b>
    We need increased funding for public transportation to better support the systems, public advocacy to shift people’s ideas of public transportation and car usage, and for legislation change that enforces stricter guidelines on oil and car companies, and allocates funding to public transportation.
    <p></p>
    <b>Evidence and Analysis: </b>
    <div class="container text-center">
“If you disinvest in it, then people won’t use it. But if you invest in it, arguably more people will use it because it actually becomes a service that’s usable.” (AP News)
Reducing funding is only going to make this problem worse, when we invest into public transportation, more care goes into the service, and usage is promoted more, investing a system like this is going to positive results, as a factor of why people may not use public transportation is its poor quality of service or it is dirty.
<div class="container text-center"></div>
“[Public Transport Users] tend to be lower income. They tend to be nonwhite. They tend to be disproportionately seniors or students,” (AP News)
Users of public transport tend to come from more oppressed and less fortunate backgrounds, and are likely intersections of all three of these. Students, seniors, nonwhite, and lower income citizens all have generally less power in society and are underrepresented.
<div class="container text-center"></div>
“Public transportation in the United States saved 63 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in 2018 — the equivalent of taking 16 coal power plants offline for a year” (Cal Matters)
Public Transportation can also help save our environment, while it seems like we have caused irreversible damage to our environment, it is never too late to lessen the effects of climate change and help decrease our emissions.
<div class="container text-center"></div>
“Governor Gavin Newsom’s original state budget draft, released earlier this year, sparked protests among transit agency leaders and advocates because it cut $2 billion for local transit across the state. The cut was part of an attempt by Newsom to balance the state’s $31.5 billion budget deficit. In response, leaders of some of the state’s most important transit services, including the East Bay’s AC Transit, BART, and Los Angeles’s MTA, said the expected budget reductions would force them to cut critical services impacting millions of people.” (The Oaklandside)
Cutting a service by such a significant amount would be greatly negatively impacting the service, the many public transportation systems are government corporations, meaning they rely on government funding as they do not make a profit, so when funding is cut the service quality will go drastically down. The amount of services will go down too, the number of trains and buses will decrease, and the frequency of them will decrease as well. Decreasing funding affects the millions of people who use these services, and while it is not a majority of the population, it is still a significant portion of the population that depend on these systems of transportation for a variety of reasons.

<b>Sources and Credibility: </b>

1. AP News, or the Associated Press, is a not-for-profit cooperative founded in New York, with high credibility, with a slight bias towards the left-center.
<p></p>
2. Cal Matters, is a nonpartisan and nonprofit news organization based in California, reporting on a wide variety of perspectives on complex issues, looking for who they affect and how they affect those people. It has a Left to Left-Center bias, with high credibility.
<p></p>
3. The Oaklandside, is a small team of Oakland Journalists that investigate root causes of issues to really educate the Oakland population on problems, causes, and solutions. They are credible as they are a local news organization, focusing on Oakland news, with a potential left bias. I was not able to find any information on their credibility or bias online.
