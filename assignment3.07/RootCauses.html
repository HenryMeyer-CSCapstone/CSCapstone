    <h1>Root Causes</h1>
    <h2> Issue: Car Usage in America is far too high while usage of public transportation is far too low </h2>
    <h4>
      <div class="container text-center">
      <b>Root Cause 1:</b> Lack of funding of public transportation systems decreases ridership, without investment to improve ride quality and promote usage, less people are going to want to use these systems, and less of these systems will be available, which affects the least well off people in our communities. This will inevitably lead to even less funding for these systems, we need to invest lots of money into public transportation rather than decrease funding to see results.
      <div class="container text-center">
      <p></p>
      <b>Evidence and Explanation 1: </b>To begin we can compare California cities to an ideal city, New York City, which I believe is a good basis for what we should achieve with our public transportation across the country. In TRANSIT FUNDING; WHY THE POLITICS? A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING IN NEW YORK CITY AND LOS ANGELES by Claudia Huerta, it states that New York’s MTA has “an annual budget of more than $13 billion” and “moves about 8.5 million riders per day or 2.5 billion passengers a year” on its public transportation services compared to Los Angeles’ METRO which has “an annual budget of $4 billion” and “has over 460 million annual trips or an average of 1.3 million rides per day,” displaying a clear relationship between funding of public transportation and usage. New York City is investing more than 3 times the amount Los Angeles is, and as a result can move almost 6 times as many passengers through public transportation each year. New York City heavily invests in their public transportation systems, and as a result, ridership is extremely high, there is a direct cause shown here with funding and usage of these systems so it is important we are investing large amounts of money into them. 
      Narrowing our lens to Oakland, Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed a “cut $2 billion for local transit across the state,” which The Oaklandside believes that “budget reductions would force them to cut critical services impacting millions of people,” many of which reside in Oakland and use BART. These budget cuts are going to only exacerbate existing problems, such as late buses and trains, reduced options and availability, and safety and cleanliness of these systems, so it will only end up making problems worse. It is also important we keep these systems as in an interview from AP News, an expert states “[Public Transport Users] tend to be lower income. They tend to be nonwhite. They tend to be disproportionately seniors or students,” which not only means public transportation users are often the least privileged members of our societies but that this system creates segregation between users of public transportation and cars. Public transit users are typically people without power or authority in our society and are not able to advocate for change on their own. We are taking away even more resources than we already have from these marginalized individuals, and giving more power to the already powerful car and gas companies and users by not funding public transportation more in our country.
      <p></p>
      <div class="container text-center">
      <b>Potential Solutions 1:</b> The obvious solution is to put more funding into public transportation systems, with more money, public transportation systems are able to expand their networks, availability, and quality of service, which will incline more people to use it. However, another solution is for our country to stop funding and investing so heavily in car, oil, and gas companies. People will save lots of time and money by using public transportation in return for their own personal convenience, as public transportation is cheaper, easier to use, and quicker as it does not have to deal with the issue of traffic congestion on highways.
      <div class="container text-center">
      <p></p>
      <b>Root Cause 2:</b> Suburbanization of American cities, suburbs; residential communities outside of larger cities, quickly spread throughout the country, as a result of cheap housing and white flight in response to racial minorities living in these cities. Suburbs are far from any necessities with the only reasonable means of transportation being cars. This creates massive amounts of pollution, and destroys existing environments to inefficiently use land to build homes. We focus too much on accommodating cars, rather than supporting the people in these cities.
      <div class="container text-center">
      <p></p>
      <b>Evidence and Explanation 2:</b> In 1946, the first suburb, Levittown, right outside of New York City, was created; it served as affordable housing for working class white Americans who had fled the city in response racial fears caused by increased immigration into the city. These towns were made on the basis of discrimination, trying to preserve white neighborhoods, and as a result, many more began popping up around the country. In Transit Funding; Why The Politics? A Comparative Study Of Public Transportation Infrastructure Funding In New York City and Los Angeles by Claudia Huerta says how “Suburban sprawl and automobile dependence ha[ve] undermined support and funding for mass transit in Los Angeles and New York, and has instead dedicated funding from gas tax revenues to highways,” showing how suburbanization is directly affecting the overuse of cars in America. The creation of more and more suburbs is only going to make this problem of cars worse, as well as create many other problems because suburbs are “associated with an increase in average trip lengths and high levels of private car usage, which causes more greenhouse gas emissions,” as the pollution caused by cars, especially car usage in suburbs, continues deplete the condition of our ecosystem and planet (Claudia Huerta). We can stay optimistic however, as Cal Matters has found “Public transportation in the United States saved 63 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in 2018 — the equivalent of taking 16 coal power plants offline for a year,” meaning if we stay optimistic and implement public transit more into our societies, we will be able to put a positive change in our fight to stop the effects of climate change. In The Transport Rich and the Transport Poor: Car dependency and social class in four European cities by James Wickham and Maria Lohan they state “cities are designed for those with cars, those who are too young or too old to drive are excluded,” we are just denying access and freedom to use the cities we have created if someone is unable to drive, leaving many children feel isolated and stuck when their only means of transportation is through cars.
In Lots of Parking: Land Use in a Car Culture by John Jakle and Keith Scule, a deep dive is taken into root causes of our culture of cars and parking, stating that  “Parking pervades our lives to the extent that we too are substantially dependent on our automobiles for everyday mobility,” that in America we are unable to escape cars, they impact and influence everything around us, to where our entire society is build around them. Cities and stores are built to accommodate cars, and do not care about those using public transportation or walking. It is so pervasive, that in the 1940s, “Demolition downtown became a growth industry in virtually every American city,” and “property owners in most cities persisted in viewing the clearing of buildings for parking as a kind of short-term expedience,” destroying hundreds of buildings in large cities across the country that served communities with housing, goods, or other value, to make room for parking, as what they believed would be a temporary convenience for the drivers. Our cities are yet to recover from this, and in any large city in America, you will find a large amount of space devoted to parking. So much so that “On average, in U.S. cities with over 1 million people, 22% of land in the city center is used for parking,” San Bernardino having as much as “49%” of their land being dedicated to parking (The Hill). A fixation on dedicating land to parking has ruined our large cities, land is not spent creating more housing, business, or public spaces, things that would actually help the people in these cities. It is instead devoted to storing away private vehicles to satisfy individuals and make their lives more convenient at the moment. There is an obsession with personal private modes of transportation rather than public transit, which will allow for much more space, and healthier communities.
      <div class="container text-center">
      <p></p>
      <b>Potential Solutions 2:</b> Increased usage of public transportation, creation of more businesses, and increased urbanization will all help stop suburban sprawl, and as a result help rebuild and create new closely bonded communities and increase usage of public transportation. More people will have access to all the resources they need close to home, and have less need for a car, which will increase public transit usage, all improving quality of life.
